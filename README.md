# Advent of Code 2019

This repo will contain my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2019, some of the code will probably be shitty due to trying to get the answer quickly, but I'll try my best to clean up if I have the energy :)

You can run any solution from the root of the project by running:  
`node day01/day01.js`

In general, part 1 will be the first line returned and part 2 will be the second, for this example:  
`3152038`  
`4725210`

Some future puzzles may require different output, so it may not always be consistent.
